The Eyam Sports Association is made up local volunteers who contribute to promote sport in Eyam,
as well as oversee ongoing maintainance of the cricket pitch, football pitch and play area/MUGA.


We meet typically on the last Thursday of the month, the next meeting scheduled for 18th July at 7.30pm at the Mechanics.
